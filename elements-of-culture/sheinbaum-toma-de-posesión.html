                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <div class="introduction-section">
                        <p>Welcome to this lesson on Mexican politics. <strong>Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo</strong> took office as Mexico's first woman president on Tuesday, October 1, 2024. She was Mexico City's mayor. She has a Ph.D in energy engineering from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that she sat on when she served as the Minister of the Environment for Mexico City won a Nobel Prize. (You can read more about her on Wikipedia in <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sheinbaum" target="_blank">Spanish</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sheinbaum" target="_blank">English</a>.)</p>
                        <p>Claudia Scheinbaum is the first woman to become president and commander of the armed forces in the 200 years of the Republic of Mexico. She received 60% of the country's vote. She follows 65 presidents who were men. She became president around 70 years after women were given the right to vote. Mexico's federal government branches (Deputy's Chamber, Senate) have gender parity in representation of women and men (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2023/10/02/mexico-set-to-elect-first-female-president-after-years-of-gender-equality-legislation/" target="_blank">Forbes Mexico</a>).</p>
