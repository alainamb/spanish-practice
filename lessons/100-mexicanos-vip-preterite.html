                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                        <p>Welcome to <strong>100 Mexicanos VIP</strong>, known in the United States as <strong>Family Feud</strong>! In this lesson, we'll focus on practicing the preterite tense. This activity is also useful in the scenarios you'll work with. Here you can learn some common things that people say when they're late, when something broke, when they've forgotten something, etc.</p>
                        <p>Along with being a fun way to practice Spanish, this activity also gives us the chance to think about the cultural adaptation that often needs to happen in translation. In Mexico, Family Feud is called: <strong>100 Mexicanos VIP</strong>. The cultural adaptation of the title makes sense. In Mexico, family is a much stronger cultural value compared with the individualism of the United States, so a direct translation of "Family Feud" may result in a title that is counter to cultural values. The shift in the title from focusing on a feud between two families to the 100 people surveyed is strategic and helps to ensure the local cultural resonance of the game.</p>

                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <div class="instructions-section">
                        <p>In this activity, you'll practice using the <strong>preterite</strong> tense while playing a game inspired by <strong>100 Mexicanos VIP</strong>. Remember, the preterite is one of the two main ways of expressing past tense in Spanish. Take some time to review/recall how the preterite works. For each round, you'll see a survey question and need to guess the top 5 preterite answers given by respondents.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read the survey question carefully</li>
                            <li>Click on one of the 10 answer buttons to make your guess</li>
                            <li>If your answer is in the top 5, it will be revealed on the board</li>
                            <li>If your answer is not in the top 5, you'll get an X (strike)</li>
                            <li>Try to reveal all 5 top answers before getting 3 strikes</li>
                            <li>Click "Next Question" to move to a new survey question</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All answers use the preterite tense, so pay attention to verb conjugations!</p>
