                    <h3>Grammar</h3>
                    <div class="instructions-section">
                        <p>In language, <strong>grammar</strong> refers to the <strong>building blocks of language</strong>, such as personal pronouns (`I`, `you`, and `we` in English and `yo`, `tú`, and `nosotros` or `nosotras` in Spanish), articles (the, a, an, some), and prepositions (of, at). We use different elements from the building blocks of grammar to <strong>construct sentences</strong> when we <strong>communicate</strong>.</p>
                        <p>As you learn about grammar:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You’ll also learn the names for different types of grammatical structures.</li>
                            <li>You’ll be able to start putting sentences together</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Get practice related to specific aspects of grammar in this collection of lessons.</p>

                    <h3>Verbs</h3>
                    <div class="instructions-section">
                        <p>Here are lessons associated specifically with <strong>verbs</strong>. Verbs are <strong>action words</strong>. Verbs can be used to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe what you and other people are like</li>
                            <li>Describe what you and other people do</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Within the basic `subject + verb + object` (SVO) sentence structure, verbs describe the action the subject takes. Spanish is a language in which the verb need to be conjugated (changed in form) to correspond with the subject. You can practice verb conjugation in these practice drills.</p>

                    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
                    <div class="instructions-section">
                        <p>In these lessons, we’ll work on building up the number of <strong>nouns</strong> (people, places and things), <strong>adjectives</strong> (words that describe nouns), and <strong>adverbs</strong> (words that describe verbs) in your <strong>vocabulary</strong>.</p>
                        <p>When we work on vocabulary:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We’ll be working with themed lists of words.</li>
                            <li>You’ll be encouraged to use the vocabulary along with building blocks from grammar and verbs to communicate about a topic.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This section is for <strong>purpose-driven communication</strong>. That is, this section focuses on modeling <strong>coversations that people typically have</strong> in a language.</p>
                        <p>Remember:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Communication is a purpose-drive activity.</strong> We need to be able to ask and answer questions and chain coherent strings of thought together into narratives.</li>
                            <li>If you’ve been understood, you’ve achieved a primary purpose of communication, no matter if your delivery was completely correct or not.</li>
                        </ul>
