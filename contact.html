                                    <p>My name is <strong>Alaina Brandt</strong>, and I designed this Spanish Practice web application. I specialize in Spanish and English language learning and translation and localization. Recently, I’ve been developing my skills as a web designer and programmer.</p>
                                    <p>I enjoy teaching Spanish very much. I consider it to be part of my lifelong language learning journey. It’s rewarding to work with students and to experience their communicative growth. I understand that language learning requires ongoing practice. I also believe that taking a systematic approach can help students to internalize a language more quickly. That’s why I’m developing this application.</p>
                                    <p>If you’d like to learn more about my work with languages and technology, discuss collaboration opportunities, or connect about translation or natural language processing research, I’d love to hear from you.</p>
                                    <p>If you’re interested in studying Spanish (or a wide variety of additional languages), I encourage you to explore what UW-Milwaukee’s School of Continuing Education has to offer!</p>
